1. We need to create a new user with privileges in mysql!
	- SSH into the instance.
	- Then login to mysql with username="root", password="qqYLnQ2mQACw" (this is the bitnami application password).
	- mysql> CREATE USER 'dhawal'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '{password}';
	- mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'dhawal'@'%';
	- mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
	- mysql> exit;

2. We need to enable load data from local infile:
	- open `stack/mysql/conf/my.cnf`
	- add the following line under [client] and [mysql] section
	- local_infile=ON
	- then restart mysql or just reboot the instance
