- We need to create a new user with privileges in mysql!
- SSH into the instance.
- Then login to mysql with username="root", password="qqYLnQ2mQACw" (this is the bitnami application password).
- mysql> CREATE USER 'dhawal'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '{password}';
- mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'dhawal'@'%';
- mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
- mysql> exit;
